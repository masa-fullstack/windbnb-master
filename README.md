## Overview

![screenshot](./images/demo.jpg)

Developed with NextJS + Tailwindcss.<br/>
<br/>
For the NextJS template, I used the NextJS Typescript Boilerplate from the official examples.<br/>
<br/>
For CSS, I used Tailwindcss.<br/>
During development, I used docker-compose to build the development environment.<br/>

Thanks for viewing :)
